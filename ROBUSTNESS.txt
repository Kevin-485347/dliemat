For the rotation R we can find the rotation axis as the eigenvector R a = a. That is the only axis 
for which the Rotation has no effects. The rotation can be then replaced by the vector (exponential) that can be 
generally expressed as f(theta)*an with an unitary. Typically f(theta)=theta while Tsai proposes 2sin(theta/2). Note that
with this last form we are simply using the double the xyz part of the unitary Quaternion.

The choice of f(theta) can affect the numerical stability of the operations and their use.

First let's see which are the operation in the parametric space and then the changes needed by non-standard f(theta):

- exp(p) known. Tsai form does not require trig
- log(R) one option is the quaternion version
- slerp: in the slerp we have exp(alpha*log)   UNKNOWN
- mean and variance estimation UNKNOWN
- covariance to sigma points
- sampling with zero mean
- distance measures
